# Leviathan Fitness Website 🏋️‍♂️
This is the frontend code for a mock fitness website that sells gym equipment. This homepage is built using React and incorporates media queries for a responsive design. I created this project to get some more experience with building front end products using React and CSS.

## Deployment 👨‍💻
The website has been deployed and can be viewed at the following URL: https://leviathan-fitness.pages.dev/

### Component Style Layout 🗂
Each component of the website is given its individual directory, including a JSX file and a CSS file. This makes it easier to maintain the code and allows for a cleaner and more organized code structure.

### Features ✅
* Responsive design using media queries
* Clean and organized component-based structure
* useState and useEffect React Hooks for quick updates to the site 

### Running the Code Locally 🏠
1) Clone the repoistory to your local machine
2) Navigate to the "src' project directory
3) Install the necessary dependencies ('npm install')
4) Start the development server ('npm start')

#### Inspiration 🖼
The inspiration for the design of this website was [Rogue Fitness](https://www.roguefitness.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiA3KefBhByEiwAi2LDHF56mI3bG8QBFtX7uC2pTrjmyoCf8LEsy27yDu2BIYfuNYFqJn1NhhoCFk8QAvD_BwE). I thought that the structure of their site was very modern looking and that following similar design principles would help me gain a lot of experience. (Note: The code in this directory was created completely from scratch, with the appearance of Rogue's website offering a visual guide that I used as a jumping off point).
